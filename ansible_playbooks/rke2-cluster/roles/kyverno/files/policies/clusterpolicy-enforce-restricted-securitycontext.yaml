    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      A PodDisruptionBudget limits the number of Pods of a replicated application that
      are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions. For example, a quorum-based
      application would like to ensure that the number of replicas running is never brought
      below the number needed for a quorum. As an application owner, you can create a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)
      for each application. This policy will create a PDB resource whenever a new Deployment is created.
